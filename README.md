## Obsidian Normalize Filenames

Normalizes markdown filenames (display only) into human-readable format (e.g. `hello_world.md` becomes `Hello World`).

Simple as that. You get to keep the naming conventions of your project, but it will be nicer to read in Obsidian. No configuration or data change needed.

Uses the Chicago style and assuming US English.
